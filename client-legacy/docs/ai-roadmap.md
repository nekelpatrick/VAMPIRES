## AI Improvement Roadmap

### Short Term (Prototype Readability)
- Prioritized targeting: closest enemy first, elites override when present.
- Strafing micro-movement: slight lateral drift to avoid stacking.
- Basic retreat: step back when HP < 20% while waiting for heal/revive trigger.

### Mid Term (Combat Depth)
- Ability cooldown management: idle attacks replaced by empowered strikes when AP overflow.
- Reactive defense: brief damage reduction when receiving burst damage.
- Wave coordination: stagger enemy spawns into front/back lines with lane assignments.

### Long Term (Live Ops Readiness)
- Herd behaviors: `[HORDE]` groups share buffs/debuffs and reposition to surround.
- Predictive dodging: entities bias movement away from incoming telegraphed attacks.
- Threat memory: attackers adapt based on last damage source, supporting PvP mind-games.
