# **VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES — THE NINE CIRCLES**

### **Full Game Design Document (Unity — Mobile + WebGL)**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Vampires and Werewolves — The Nine Circles** is a **[MOBILE]-first idle RPG** where the [PLAYER]—a newly awakened [VAMPIRE]—commands autonomous [THRALL] units (starting with a [WEREWOLF]) who fight endless [HORDE] waves inside a 3D side-view battlefield.
Combat is **automatic**, **continuous**, and **spectacle-driven**, with gore-heavy animations that make the idle loop visually **[MESMERIZING]** and **[ADDICTIVE]**.

Players collect **[DUSKEN COIN]** (soft currency) and **[BLOOD SHARDS]** (premium currency), upgrade their [THRALL]s, enter PvP duels, survive [DEATH], and participate in clan-based seasonal conflicts.

Monetization centers on purchases, cosmetics, revives, PvP convenience, and an ongoing subscription tier called **[ASHEN ONE]**.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 2. GAME PILLARS

1. **Idle Brutality**

   - Visually stunning, bloody, stylized side-view auto-combat.

2. **Thrall Leadership Fantasy**

   - The [PLAYER] is a master [VAMPIRE] commanding loyal [THRALL]s.

3. **Progression Through Blood**

   - Powerful stat upgrades, gory evolutions, mutations, and clan-aligned bonuses.

4. **Risk and Death**

   - PvP with real danger. If your [THRALL] falls into [DEATH], you must revive it through resources or time.

5. **Persistent Online World**

   - Shared [BATTLEFIELD] instances populated by [NPC]s and other [PLAYER]s.

6. **Monetization Without Shame**

   - A premium layer built for value and identity: **[ASHEN ONE]** subscription, avatar generation, cosmetics, and VIP perks.

7. **Mobile-First Unity Technology**

   - Smooth, performant 3D in Unity with MonoBehaviour/ECS logic and server authoritative combat.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 3. STORY & SETTING

## 3.1 Overview

The [PLAYER], a dormant [VAMPIRE], awakens from centuries of **[VAMPIRE SLUMBER]** in the middle of a brutal **[CIVIL WAR]** between three great [CLAN]s:

### The Three Vampire [CLAN]s (canonical names)

1. **CLAN NOCTURNUM**
   Ancient royalty. Masters of blood rituals. Passive lifesteal bonuses.
2. **CLAN SABLEHEART**
   Martial aristocrats. Known for brutality and blade mastery. Attack/crit bonuses.
3. **CLAN ECLIPSA**
   Arcane manipulators and shadowbinders. Status effects, curses, and bleed bonuses.

## 3.2 The Lackey (Onboarding Guide)

The Lackey is the first speaking character. He:

- explains the [VAMPIRE]’s awakening
- introduces the [CIVIL WAR]
- gives the first [THRALL] (a young [WEREWOLF])
- walks the player into recruiting, upgrades, currencies, PvP risk, and resurrection systems

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 4. GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS (CORE)

## 4.1 The [THRALL]

The [THRALL] is the player’s main unit.

- Always 3D, animated, with several attack patterns.
- Auto-attacks enemies via server-authoritative combat.
- Has: HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Crit, Resistances, Abilities.
- Can evolve or mutate into stronger forms as levels increase.
- Displays a **HP bar (above)** and **Name Bar (below)**.

The starter [THRALL] is always the **[WEREWOLF]**.

## 4.2 The [BATTLEFIELD]

- A 3D side-view arena built in Unity.
- Infinite waves of enemies.
- Instanced using GPU Instancing and object pooling to keep performance stable.
- Visuals: rotating layers of fog, silhouettes, embers, blood particle systems (VFX Graph).
- Players will see many [NPC]s and other [PLAYER]s' thralls marching beside them.

## 4.3 [HORDE] AI (ENEMIES)

- Procedurally spawning enemies of varying archetypes.
- Horde composition changes as time increases.
- Elite enemies every X waves.
- Boss waves (big rewards).

All enemies are 3D low-poly models that match the darkest-dungeon style.

## 4.4 PvP Mode

Player chooses to send their [THRALL] to PvP:

- Matched against other [PLAYER] thralls.
- Possible [DEATH] is a core risk.
- Outcomes resolved server-side with deterministic simulation.
- Players cannot know if they are facing a [STRONGER] opponent.
- Rewards: more [DUSKEN COIN], some [BLOOD SHARDS], and ranking points.

## 4.5 [DEATH] & Resurrection System

If the [THRALL] dies:

- It becomes unusable until revived.
- Revival methods:

  1. Free revive (long timer)
  2. Pay with **[DUSKEN COIN]** (cheaper but slower)
  3. Pay with **[BLOOD SHARDS]** (instant)
  4. [ASHEN ONE] discounts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 5. PROGRESSION SYSTEMS

## 5.1 XP & Levels

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 9. TECHNICAL DESIGN (UNITY CLIENT)

### 9.1 Core Technologies

- **Unity 2022 LTS** → game engine (iOS, Android, WebGL builds)
- **C#** → typed game logic
- **UniTask** → async operations without coroutine overhead
- **Unity Physics / Rigidbody** → cosmetic physics (knockbacks, ragdolls)
- **Addressables** → asset management and streaming
- **PlayerPrefs / local file** → local caching

### 9.2 Core Systems

- **Prefabs:** Thrall, Enemy, Boss, VFX, DamageNumber
- **MonoBehaviour Systems:** ThrallController, HordeSpawner, CombatManager, HPBarUI
- **ScriptableObjects:** ThrallStats, EnemyConfig, WaveDefinitions
- **Animator:** State machines for attack patterns, idle, death

### 9.3 Rendering Optimizations

- GPU Instancing for hordes
- VFX Graph for particles (blood, embers, fog)
- Object pooling via custom pool manager
- LOD Groups for 3D models
- URP (Universal Render Pipeline) for mobile performance

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 10. TECHNICAL DESIGN (NODE BACKEND)

Fastify is one of the most solid, production-hardened choices for a Node.js game backend today: it is actively maintained by contributors who also support Node core, is battle-tested by companies like NearForm, Microsoft, and Platformatic, and offers frequent patch releases with a stable API surface. Its lightweight, schema-driven foundation sustains top-tier throughput without hiding the routing, lifecycle, or plugin controls engineers expect. Operational reliability features—JSON schema validation, logging hooks, graceful shutdown, HTTP/2/WebSocket support, and plugin isolation—make it straightforward to run behind load balancers, capture observability, and execute zero-downtime deploys. The Unity client communicates via REST endpoints and WebSocket for real-time events (battle results, PvP notifications). In short, Fastify provides a dependable, well-supported base that only grows more complex when we opt in, aligning with our requirement for a solid backend without unnecessary bells and whistles.

### 10.1 Services

- **API Gateway (Fastify)**: REST + WebSocket
- **Combat Worker (Node.js)**: deterministic battle simulator
- **Matchmaker (Node.js)**: PvP queue management
- **Avatar Service (Node.js)**: handles avatar generation requests
- **Economy Service (Node.js)**: currency operations, transactions, logs

### 10.2 Persistence

- PostgreSQL → players, thralls, transactions
- Redis → matchmaking queues, caches
- S3/MinIO → user avatars

### 10.3 Battle Simulation (Deterministic)

- Seeded RNG
- Tick-based engine
- Event logs
- Final summary stored and returned to client

### 10.4 Networking

- REST for basic CRUD
- WebSocket for push notifications (battle ready, PvP result)
- All state changes validated server-side

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 11. DATA MODELS (SIMPLIFIED)

### Players

- id, user_id, clan_id, dusken_balance, blood_shards_balance…

### Thralls

- id, owner_id, type, stats, abilities, status, last_revive_at

### Battles

- id, seed, participants, logs, result

### Transactions

- id, player_id, amount, currency, type, reason

### Subscriptions

- id, user_id, active_until, avatar_credits

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 12. COMBAT DESIGN

### 12.1 Tick-Based Model

Each tick (e.g., every 100ms):

- Entities gain AP (action points) based on speed
- When AP >= 100 → perform action
- Choose target deterministically
- Damage Formula:

```
damage = max(1, attacker.attack - target.defense * 0.5)
```

### 12.2 Abilities

- Lifesteal
- Bleed
- Stun
- Rage Mode
- Howl (AoE debuff)

### 12.3 PvP

- PowerScore hidden from player → only “Low / Moderate / High Threat” indicator
- True values hidden to support “Pokémon-like” uncertainty
- Results can cause [DEATH]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 13. GAME LOOP (MASTER LOOP)

1. Log in
2. Auto-fight on [BATTLEFIELD]
3. Collect [DUSKEN COIN]
4. Upgrade [THRALL]
5. Enter PvP
6. Risk [DEATH]
7. Revive
8. Recruit more thralls (later phases)
9. Progress clan standings
10. Participate in events
11. Spend [BLOOD SHARDS]
12. Repeat (idle automation)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 14. MONETIZATION DESIGN

### 14.1 Core Revenue Streams

1. **[BLOOD SHARDS]** packs
2. **[ASHEN ONE]** monthly subscription
3. Cosmetics: skins, colors
4. AI-generated portrait (subscriber-only)
5. Revives & convenience features
6. Battle Pass (seasonal)

### 14.2 Monetization Ethics

- No “forced loss” loops
- PvP fairness preserved (no direct stat purchases)
- Purchases accelerate, don’t override skill/progression

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 15. MVP SCOPE

### MVP Includes:

- 1 Thrall type: [WEREWOLF]
- Base [BATTLEFIELD]

# 18. RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk                     | Mitigation                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low FPS on mobile        | GPU Instancing, LOD Groups, URP, gore intensity slider            |
| Perceived pay-to-win     | Cosmetic-first monetization; limit stat differences               |
| Server combat cost       | Worker autoscaling, Redis queue batching                          |
| Large build size         | Addressables, model compression, asset streaming, texture atlases |
| Abusive PvP exploitation | Matchmaking variance + cooldowns                                  |
| WebGL limitations        | Fallback to native mobile builds; optimize shader complexity      |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# 19. IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIONS (TO START THE PROJECT)

1. **Set up Unity project** with URP, folder structure (`Assets/Scripts`, `Assets/Prefabs`, `Assets/ScriptableObjects`), and basic scene.
2. **Implement Node combat worker prototype** with deterministic RNG + event logs.
3. **Create first Unity scene**: side-view camera + basic thrall prefab + idle movement + HUD canvas showing [DUSKEN COIN] & [BLOOD SHARDS].
